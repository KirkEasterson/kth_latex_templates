- The template is based on the LaTeX Classes for KTH Theses written by Lars Engebretsen.
- More details about these classes can be found here: http://system.csc.kth.se/misc/tex/

- More information about the LaTeX project can be found here: http://www.latex-project.org/
- LaTeX wiki page: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX
- Introduction for using LaTeX (just one example): https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

- The main document (Lic.tex or Doc.tex) calls all the other included documents.
- Please note that some parts of the template are just explanatory notes and should be deleted or commented before a final document is produced.
- The template is using some packages that have to be installed first. The used packages are not mandatory to use but rather a good example. Everyone is free to use his/her preferred packages. The information about how to install packages can be found here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installing_Extra_Packages
- Every section (chapter) of the thesis is a separate document. This makes it easier to update the whole thesis when working with different versions of the same chapter or when using external documents.
