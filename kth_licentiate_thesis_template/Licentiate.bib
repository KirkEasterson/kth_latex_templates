abstract = {Motivated by emerging battery-operated applications that demand compact, lightweight, and highly efficient DC-DC power converters, a buck circuit is presented in which all active devices are integrated on a single chip using a standard 1.2 \&amp;mu; CMOS process. The circuit delivers 750 mW at 1.5 V from a 6 V battery. To effectively eliminate switching loss at high operating frequencies, the power transistors achieve nearly ideal zero-voltage switching (ZVS) through an adjustable dead-time control scheme. The silicon area and power consumption of the gate-drive buffers are reduced with a tapering factor that minimizes short-circuit current and dynamic dissipation for a given technology and application. Measured results on a prototype IC indicate that on-chip losses at full load can be kept below 8\% at 1 MHz},

abstract = {Emerging microsystems such as portable and implantable medical electronics, wireless microsensors and next-generation portable multimedia devices demand a dramatic reduction in energy consumption. The ultimate goal is to power these devices using energy harvesting techniques such as vibration-to-electric conversion or through wireless power transmission. A major opportunity to reduce the energy consumption of digital circuits is to scale supply voltages to 0.5V and below. The challenges associated with ultra-low-voltage design will be presented. These include variation-aware design for logic and SRAM circuits, efficient DC-DC converters for ultra-low-voltage delivery, and algorithm structuring to support extreme parallelism. This paper also addresses micro-power analog and RF circuits, which require the use of application-specific structures and highly digital variation-aware architectures.},

abstract = {Implantable medical devices usually require a battery to operate and this can represent a severe restriction. In most cases, the implantable medical devices must be surgically replaced because of the dead batteries; therefore, the longevity of the whole implantable medical device is determined by the battery lifespan. For this reason, researchers have been studying energy harvesting techniques from the human body in order to obtain batteryless implantable medical devices. The human body is a rich source of energy and this energy can be harvested from body heat, breathing, arm motion, leg motion or the motion of other body parts produced during walking or any other activity. In particular, the main human-body energy sources are kinetic energy and thermal energy. This paper reviews the state-of-art in kinetic and thermoelectric energy harvesters for powering implantable medical devices. Kinetic energy harvesters are based on electromagnetic, electrostatic and piezoelectric conversion. The different energy harvesters are analyzed highlighting their sizes, energy or power they produce and their relative applications. As they must be implanted, energy harvesting devices must be limited in size, typically about 1 cm 3. The available energy depends on human-body positions; therefore, some positions are more advantageous than others. For example, favorable positions for piezoelectric harvesters are hip, knee and ankle where forces are significant. The energy harvesters here reported produce a power between 6 nW and 7.2 mW; these values are comparable with the supply requirements of the most common implantable medical devices; this demonstrates that energy harvesting techniques is a valid solution to design batteryless implantable medical devices.

abstract = {This paper aims to develop a novel adaptive gate switching controller (AGSC) for discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) dc\&\#x2013;dc converters, in an attempt to reduce the power losses caused by nonideal gate switching operations. The proposed AGSC employs a dead-time controller (DTC) and a zero-current detector (ZCD) to turn ON and OFF the synchronous switch, respectively. Both the DTC and the ZCD perform self-calibration according to the converter switching node voltage, allowing the AGSC achieves near-optimal gate switching control regardless of the operating frequency, process variation, power device variation, as well as source voltage and load current variation. The proposed AGSC can have useful applications in many DCM dc\&\#x2013;dc converters, e.g., buck, boost, and buck\&\#x2013;boost converters. For a proof of concept, in this paper, a boost converter was implemented with the proposed AGSC in a 0.18-\&\#x03BC;m 3.3-V CMOS process with an area of 1.5\&\#x00A0;mm<formula formulatype="inline"><tex Notation="TeX">\$\^{}\{2\}\$ </tex></formula>.

abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Endocochlear potential (EP) is a battery-like electrochemical gradient found in and actively maintained by the inner ear. Here we demonstrate that the mammalian EP can be used as a power source for electronic devices. We achieved this by designing an anatomically sized, ultra-low quiescent-power energy harvester chip integrated with a wireless sensor capable of monitoring the EP itself. Although other forms of in vivo energy harvesting have been described in lower organisms, and thermoelectric, piezoelectric and biofuel devices are promising for mammalian applications, there have been few, if any, in vivo demonstrations in the vicinity of the ear, eye and brain. In this work, the chip extracted a minimum of 1.12 nW from the EP of a guinea pig for up to 5 h, enabling a 2.4 GHz radio to transmit measurement of the EP every 40-360 s. With future optimization of electrode design, we envision using the biologic battery in the inner ear to power chemical and molecular sensors, or drug-delivery actuators for diagnosis and therapy of hearing loss and other disorders.},

abstract = {An approach is presented for minimizing power consumption for digital systems implemented in CMOS which involves optimization at all levels of the design. This optimization includes the technology used to implement the digital circuits, the circuit style and topology, the architecture for implementing the circuits and at the highest level the algorithms that are being implemented. The most important technology consideration is the threshold voltage and its control which allows the reduction of supply voltage without significant impact on logic speed. Even further supply reductions can be made by the use of an architecture-based voltage scaling strategy, which uses parallelism and pipelining, to tradeoff silicon area and power reduction. Since energy is only consumed when capacitance is being switched power can be reduced by minimizing this capacitance through operation reduction choice of number representation, exploitation of signal correlations, resynchronization to minimize glitching, logic design, circuit design, and physical design. The low-power techniques that are presented have been applied to the design of a chipset for a portable multimedia terminal that supports pen input, speech I/O and full-motion video. The entire chipset that performs protocol conversion, synchronization, error correction, packetization, buffering, video decompression and D/A conversion operates from a 1.1 V supply and consumes less than 5 mW},

abstract = {A 0.9-V input discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) boost converter delivering 2.5-V and 100-mA output is presented. A novel low-voltage pulse-width modulator is proposed. The modulator can be directly powered from the 0.9-V input instead of using the 2.5-V output as in general modulator designs. Sophisticated low-voltage analog blocks, which normally consume a large amount of power and chip area, are not required in the modulator. The impact of output-voltage ripple and transient-induced output-voltage perturbation on the operation of analog blocks inside the modulator is eliminated. Boost converter start-up sequence is also greatly simplified. A CMOS-control rectifier (CCR) is also proposed to improve converter power efficiency. The CCR is used to replace the conventional rectifying switch to provide adaptive dead-time, which helps to minimize charge-sharing loss and body-diode conduction loss. Corresponding thermal stress on the rectifying switch is hence minimized. The CCR also enables the use of small off-chip inductor and capacitor at sub-MHz switching frequency to improve light-load efficiency. This converter has been implemented in a 0.35- mum CMOS process. It is designed to operate at \~{} 667 kHz with a 1 mu H inductor and 4.7 mu F output capacitor to reduce both switching loss and form factor. Experimental results prove that the converter can be directly powered from 0.9-V input with \~{} 85\% efficiency at 100-mA output.},

The resulting voltage is equal to the extrapolated threshold voltage of a MOSFET at absolute zero temperature, which was about 745 mV for the MOSFETs we used. The temperature coefficient of the voltage was 7 ppm/degC at best and 15 ppm/degC on average, in a range from - 20 to 80degC. The line sensitivity was 20 ppm/V in a supply voltage range of 1.4-3 V, and the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) was -45 dB at 100 Hz. The power dissipation was 0.3 muW at 80degC.

Biosens. Bioelectron.]. Within this review a brief description will firstly be given of the history of biofuel cells together with coverage of some of the major historical advances. The review is intended, however, to largely concentrate on and give an overview of the advances made in recent years in this area together with a discussion surrounding the practical application of biofuel cells. There are several classes of biofuel cells: we shall firstly discuss the recent advances in biofuel cells that convert chemical fuels to produce electrical power by use of catalytic enzymes. This will be followed by a section on similar cells where micro-organisms rather than enzymes are used to convert the fuel to energy. Thirdly we shall consider hybrid biofuel cells that combine the utilisation of photochemical chemistries and biological systems for the generation of electricity. Finally we will discuss some of the proposed uses of biofuel cells together with a short consideration of future research possibilities and applications of these systems.},

Energy scavengers usually work at a small temperature difference and high thermal resistance of the heat source and sink, i.e., of the environment. The name âthermal shuntâ is given to this component because, firstly, it is connected thermally in parallel to a certain zone of the environment in the vicinity of a thermopile and, secondly, it shunts this zone thermally. As a result, the heat flow through the thermopile increases, improving its performance characteristics.},

abstract = {There are clear trade-offs between functionality, battery lifetime and battery volume for wearable and implantable wireless-biosensors which energy harvesting devices may be able to overcome. Reliable energy harvesting has now become a reality for machine condition monitoring and is finding applications in chemical process plants, refineries and water treatment works. However, practical miniature devices that can harvest sufficient energy from the human body to power a wireless bio-sensor are still in their infancy. This paper reviews the options for human energy harvesting in order to determine power availability for harvester-powered body sensor networks. The main competing technologies for energy harvesting from the human body are inertial kinetic energy harvesting devices and thermoelectric devices. These devices are advantageous to some other types as they can be hermetically sealed. In this paper the fundamental limit to the power output of these devices is compared as a function of generator volume when attached to a human whilst walking and running. It is shown that the kinetic energy devices have the highest fundamental power limits in both cases. However, when a comparison is made between the devices using device effectivenesses figures from previously demonstrated prototypes presented in the literature, the thermal device is competitive with the kinetic energy harvesting device when the subject is running and achieves the highest power density when the subject is walking.},

abstract = {As interest in energy-harvesting sensor nodes continues to grow, the use of supercapacitors as energy stores or buffers is gaining popularity. The reasons for their use are numerous, and include their high power density, simple interfacing requirements, simpler measurement of state-of-charge, and a greater number of charging cycles than secondary batteries. However, supercapacitor energy densities are orders of magnitude lower. Furthermore, they have been reported to exhibit significant leakage, and this has been shown to increase exponentially with terminal voltage (and hence stored energy). This observation has resulted in a number of algorithms, designs and methods being proposed for effective operation of supercapacitor-based energy-harvesting sensor nodes. In this paper, it is argued that traditional âleakageâ is not as significant as has commonly been suggested. Instead, what is observed as leakage is in fact predominantly due to internal charge redistribution. As a result, it is suggested that different approaches are required in order to effectively utilize supercapacitors in energy-harvesting sensor nodes.},

abstract = {We have developed an implantable fuel cell that generates power through glucose oxidation, producing 3.4 $\mu$W cm(-2) steady-state power and up to 180 $\mu$W cm(-2) peak power. The fuel cell is manufactured using a novel approach, employing semiconductor fabrication techniques, and is therefore well suited for manufacture together with integrated circuits on a single silicon wafer. Thus, it can help enable implantable microelectronic systems with long-lifetime power sources that harvest energy from their surrounds. The fuel reactions are mediated by robust, solid state catalysts. Glucose is oxidized at the nanostructured surface of an activated platinum anode. Oxygen is reduced to water at the surface of a self-assembled network of single-walled carbon nanotubes, embedded in a Nafion film that forms the cathode and is exposed to the biological environment. The catalytic electrodes are separated by a Nafion membrane. The availability of fuel cell reactants, oxygen and glucose, only as a mixture in the physiologic environment, has traditionally posed a design challenge: Net current production requires oxidation and reduction to occur separately and selectively at the anode and cathode, respectively, to prevent electrochemical short circuits. Our fuel cell is configured in a half-open geometry that shields the anode while exposing the cathode, resulting in an oxygen gradient that strongly favors oxygen reduction at the cathode. Glucose reaches the shielded anode by diffusing through the nanotube mesh, which does not catalyze glucose oxidation, and the Nafion layers, which are permeable to small neutral and cationic species. We demonstrate computationally that the natural recirculation of cerebrospinal fluid around the human brain theoretically permits glucose energy harvesting at a rate on the order of at least 1 mW with no adverse physiologic effects. Low-power brain-machine interfaces can thus potentially benefit from having their implanted units powered or recharged by glucose fuel cells.},

abstract = {Electrical energy is a high quality form of energy that can be easily converted to other forms of energy with high efficiency and, even more importantly, it can be used to control lower grades of energy quality with ease. However, building a cost-effective electrical energy storage (EES) system is a challenging task despite steady advances in the design and manufacturing of EES elements including various battery and supercapacitor technologies. As of today, no single type of EES element fulfills high energy density, high power delivery capacity, low cost per unit of storage, long cycle life, low leakage, and so on at the same time. Unlike conventional EES systems, we introduce a HEES (hybrid EES) system comprising heterogeneous EES elements. Our proposed HEES system builds on the concepts of computer memory system architecture and management in order to achieve the attributes of an ideal EES system through appropriate allocation and organization of various types of EES elements.

abstract = {From the first pacemaker implant in 1958, numerous engineering and medical activities for implantable medical device development have faced challenges in materials, battery power, functionality, electrical power consumption, size shrinkage, system delivery, and wireless communication. With explosive advances in scientific and engineering technology, many implantable medical devices such as the pacemaker, cochlear implant, and real-time blood pressure sensors have been developed and improved. This trend of progress in medical devices will continue because of the coming super-aged society, which will result in more consumers for the devices. The inner body is a special space filled with electrical, chemical, mechanical, and marine-salted reactions. Therefore, electrical connectivity and communication, corrosion, robustness, and hermeticity are key factors to be considered during the development stage. The main participants in the development stage are the user, the medical staff, and the engineer or technician. Thus, there are three different viewpoints in the development of implantable devices. In this review paper, considerations in the development of implantable medical devices will be presented from the viewpoint of an engineering mind.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has provided remarkable benefits for people with a variety of neurologic conditions. Stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus can dramatically relieve tremor associated with essential tremor or Parkinson disease (PD). Similarly, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or the internal segment of the globus pallidus can substantially reduce bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and gait difficulties in people with PD. Multiple groups are attempting to extend this mode of treatment to other conditions. Yet, the precise mechanism of action of DBS remains uncertain. Such studies have importance that extends beyond clinical therapeutics. Investigations of the mechanisms of action of DBS have the potential to clarify fundamental issues such as the functional anatomy of selected brain circuits and the relationship between activity in those circuits and behavior. Although we review relevant clinical issues, we emphasize the importance of current and future investigations on these topics.},

The present report examines current issues related to audiologic, clinical, engineering, anatomic, and physiologic aspects of cochlear implants, focusing on their psychophysical, speech, music, and cognitive performance. This report also forecasts clinical and research trends related to presurgical evaluation, fitting protocols, signal processing, and postsurgical rehabilitation in cochlear implants.

The low-complexity single-stage architecture, in combination with aggressive power gating techniques and sizing optimizations, limited the standby power of the transmitter to only 39.7 pW at 0.8 V. Supporting both OOK and FSK modulations at 2.4 GHz, the transmitter consumed as low as 38 pJ/bit at an active-mode data rate of 5 Mbps. The loop antenna and integrated diodes were also used as part of a wireless power transfer receiver in order to kick-start the system power supply prior to energy harvesting operation.},

Ambient structural vibrations are reliably measured at a low cost and without interfering with the operation of the bridge. Requirements that SHM imposes on WSN are identified and new solutions to meet these requirements are proposed and implemented. In the GGB deployment, 64 nodes are distributed over the main span and the tower, collecting ambient vibrations synchronously at 1kHz rate, with less than 10$\mu$s jitter, and with an accuracy of 30$\mu$G. The sampled data is collected reliably over a 46-hop network, with a bandwidth of 441B/s at the 46th hop. The collected data agrees with theoretical models and previous studies of the bridge. The deployment is the largest WSN for SHM.},

abstract = {Friction has long been the subject of research: the empirical da Vinci-Amontons friction laws have been common knowledge for centuries. Macroscopic experiments performed by the school of Bowden and Tabor revealed that macroscopic friction can be related to the collective action of small asperities. Over the last 15 years, experiments performed with the atomic force microscope have provided new insights into the physics of single asperities sliding over surfaces. This development, together with the results from complementary experiments using surface force apparatus and the quartz microbalance, have led to the new field of nanotribology. At the same time, increasing computing power has permitted the simulation of processes that occur during sliding contact involving several hundreds of atoms. It has become clear that atomic processes cannot be neglected when interpreting nanotribology experiments. Even on well-defined surfaces, experiments have revealed that atomic structure is directly linked to friction force. This chapter will describe friction force microscopy experiments that reveal, more or less directly, atomic processes during sliding contact. We will begin by introducing friction force microscopy, including the calibration of cantilever force sensors and special aspects of the ultrahigh vacuum environment. The empirical Tomlinson model often used to describe atomic stick-slip results is therefore presented in detail. We review experimental results regarding atomic friction, including thermal activation, velocity dependence and temperature dependence. The geometry of the contact is crucial to the interpretation of experimental results, such as the calculation of the lateral contact stiffness, as we shall see. The onset of wear on the atomic scale has recently been studied experimentally and it is described here. In order to compare results, we present molecular dynamics simulations that are directly related to atomic friction experiments. The chapter ends with a discussion of dissipation measurements performed in noncontact force microscopy, which may become an important complementary tool for the study of mechanical dissipation in nanoscopic devices.},

abstract = {Body sensor networks (BSNs) are emerging cyber-physical systems that promise to improve quality of life through improved healthcare, augmented sensing and actuation for the disabled, independent living for the elderly, and reduced healthcare costs. However, the physical nature of BSNs introduces new challenges. The human body is a highly dynamic physical environment that creates constantly changing demands on sensing, actuation, and quality of service (QoS). Movement between indoor and outdoor environments and physical movements constantly change the wireless channel characteristics. These dynamic application contexts can also have a dramatic impact on data and resource prioritization. Thus, BSNs must simultaneously deal with rapid changes to both top-down application requirements and bottom-up resource availability. This is made all the more challenging by the wearable nature of BSN devices, which necessitates a vanishingly small size and, therefore, extremely limited hardware resources and power budget. Current research is being performed to develop new principles and techniques for adaptive operation in highly dynamic physical environments, using miniaturized, energy-constrained devices. This paper describes a holistic cross-layer approach that addresses all aspects of the system, from low-level hardware design to higher level communication and data fusion algorithms, to top-level applications. 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {An automatic power-generating system (AGS) which converts kinetic energy into electric energy for quartz watches was tested as a power source for implantable cardiac pacemakers. An automatic power-generating mechanism and a capacitor (0.33 F) were removed from a quartz watch (SEIKO) and encapsulated in a polyvinyl case. Characteristics of the AGS were investigated by acceleration equipment. The capacitor in the AGS was charged to 2.0 V (0.66 J) by placing it on the equipment for about 30 minutes. The equipment has a 2 Hz cycle and generates +/- 1.7 G at the end of each half cycle. The AGS (fully charged to 2.0 V) was used as the power source for a pulse generator circuit built using commercially available CMOS IC. The circuit generated pulses of 0.5 ms width at 1 Hz (60 pulses min-1). The voltage of the AGS was maintained at 1.6 V while it was being charged by the accelerations. The generator supplied pulses of 0.75 V, 1.47 mA through a 510 omega load. With fully charged AGS, the generator was also used to pace a mongrel dog's heart at 140 beats min-1 for 60 minutes. During pacing, the AGS supplied 420 mJ to the circuit and the cardiac muscle. The AGS was placed on the right ventricular wall of the mongrel dog under anaesthesia. Energy of 80 mJ is stored in a capacitor by the heart beating at about 200 beats/min for 30 minutes. Thus the AGS generated 13 microJ per heart beat. This result suggests that the AGS may supply enough energy for use in a cardiac pacemaker.},

abstract = {Our living environment has an abundance of energies in the forms of light, thermal, mechanical (such as vibration, sonic wave, wind, and hydraulic), magnetic, chemical, and biological. Harvesting these types of energies is of critical importance for long-term energy needs and sustainable development of the world. Over the years, rationally designed materials and technologies have been developed for converting solar and mechanical energies into electricity. Photovoltaic relies on approaches such as inorganic pn junctions, organic thin films, and organic-inorganic heterojunctions. Mechanical energy generators have been designed based on principles of electromagnetic induction and piezoelectric effect. Innovative approaches have to be developed for conjunctional harvesting of multiple types of energies using an integrated structure/material so that the energy resources can be effectively and complimentarily utilized whenever and wherever one or all of them are available. We give a review on the hybrid cells that are designed for simultaneously harvesting solar and mechanical, and chemical and mechanical energies using nanotechnology. The two energy harvesting approaches can work simultaneously or individually, and they can be integrated in parallel and series for raising the output current and voltage, respectively. Innovative approaches have been demonstrated for developing integrated technologies for effectively scavenging available energies in our environment around the clock. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Powering future generations of implanted medical devices will require cumbersome transcutaneous energy transfer or harvesting energy from the human body. No functional solution that harvests power from the body is currently available, despite attempts to use the Seebeck thermoelectric effect, vibrations or body movements. Glucose fuel cells appear more promising, since they produce electrical energy from glucose and dioxygen, two substrates present in physiological fluids. The most powerful ones, Glucose BioFuel Cells (GBFCs), are based on enzymes electrically wired by redox mediators. However, GBFCs cannot be implanted in animals, mainly because the enzymes they rely on either require low pH or are inhibited by chloride or urate anions, present in the Extra Cellular Fluid (ECF). Here we present the first functional implantable GBFC, working in the retroperitoneal space of freely moving rats. The breakthrough relies on the design of a new family of GBFCs, characterized by an innovative and simple mechanical confinement of various enzymes and redox mediators: enzymes are no longer covalently bound to the surface of the electron collectors, which enables use of a wide variety of enzymes and redox mediators, augments the quantity of active enzymes, and simplifies GBFC construction. Our most efficient GBFC was based on composite graphite discs containing glucose oxidase and ubiquinone at the anode, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and quinone at the cathode. PPO reduces dioxygen into water, at pH 7 and in the presence of chloride ions and urates at physiological concentrations. This GBFC, with electrodes of 0.133 mL, produced a peak specific power of 24.4 microW mL(-1), which is better than pacemakers' requirements and paves the way for the development of a new generation of implantable artificial organs, covering a wide range of medical applications.},

On the basis of the electrical activation of nerves, prototype retinal prostheses have been tested in blind humans and have demonstrated the capability to elicit the sensation of light and to give test subjects the ability to detect motion. To improve the visual function in implant recipients, a more sophisticated device is required. Simulations suggest that 600-1000 pixels will be required to provide visual function such as face recognition and reading. State-of-the-art implantable stimulator technology cannot produce such a device, which mandates the advancement of the state of the art in areas such as analog microelectronics, wireless power and data transfer, packaging, and stimulating electrodes.},
